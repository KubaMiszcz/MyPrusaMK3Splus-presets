You're fighting two things. Heat creep and back pressure.\nFollowing settings work for me:\n* 240C \n* Bed temp 60C only for the first layer\n* Keep it cool (below 26C) if you're printing inside an enclosure\n* Release the bondtech gear pressure until it slips, then tighten it a little bit\n* 15mm/s for all printing speeds!!! That means also no slow down for fast layer changes or bridges. Verify it in the slicer. Movement speeds can be left fast.\n* No retractions\n\nI'm printing on my MK2.5 and MK3 NinjaFlex at 100% success rate and my printers are stock.\n\nTry this settings and let us know the results. A brief description of the issue is also important, so we can help you out.\n==\nBump up the nozzle temp. \nMake also sure that your first layer is not squished.\n==\nI haven't tried TPU with my MK3S yet, but when using the stock MK3 I noticed a huge improvement when I changed the Extruded trace width down from the default 0.45 to 0.42. Some of the back-pressure comes from squishing a 0.4mm thread into a rectangular trace. I think also that using a layer thickness of at least 0.25 is better than thinner layers.\nI may weigh in again on this topic when I have a need to print TPU again.\nAjust the Z height. If you have a tight first layer, you get more back pressure.\n==\nHere's a couple more things I discovered on the original MK3:\n\n(1) Heat creep from the Extruder motor can soften the filament when it comes in contact with the Bondtech gears. I added heat sink fins to the sides of my extruder motor, and when I print TPU I use a small desk fan blowing across the printer to keep the Extruder motor cool. Without the fins and fan, the motor can get too hot to touch; with the fins and fan, it's barely warmer than ambient.\n\n \n(2) The Print Fan is your enemy. The control circuit will keep the thermistor at the setpoint temperature, which means the upper throat of the nozzle is also pretty close to the setpoint temperature. But the more airflow there is across the nozzle, the cooler the orifice at the end of the nozzle will be. If you don't absolutely need Print Fan (e.g. for bridging), turn it off. This problem with the Print Fan becomes especially severe if you are printing a large \"pancake\" shape where the air has nowhere else to go except directly across the nozzle.\n==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just printed a 4-hour part using MatterHackers Pro TPU, using the exact same G-code for this part that I used before the MK3 to MK3S upgrade. It printed perfectly. Here are some key settings:\nLayer Height: 0.2mm\nFill: 50% Rectilinear\nSpeed: 45mm/s, but 25mm/s for small perimeters, 35mm/s for External perimeters BUT note volumetric rate limit!!!\nExtrusion Width: 0.44mm (Note: other parts printed better at 0.42mm)\nFilament Diameter: 1.75 (actually measured)\nExtrusion Multiplier: 1.150 (due to compression in the extruder body)\nExtruder Temperature: 255\nBed Temperature: 35\nPart Fan: Always on, 35% speed (Note: probably would work with zero fan)\nFilament Type: FLEX\nMax Volumetric Speed: 2mm^3/s -VERY IMPORTANT\nRetraction: 3mm\nRetraction Speed: 35 mm/s\n\n==\nI had many failed prints with TPU and my MK3S. Now I have 100% success. The changes I made to stock parameters are: lower extrusion multiplier (1.0 to .95), no retractions, and enabled auto cooling.\n\nExtrusion multiplier was the most important factor for not failing a print. With a higher extrusion ratio, the filament would build up back pressure and find a way to escape the extruder.\n\nRetractions and auto cooling were modified to improve cosmetics.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\nBen\n==\n"
